         * A Scanner object parses primitive types and Strings from a stream.
         * 
         *  A stream is a sequence of characters from a file, String, terminal,
         *      network connection, etc.
         *      
         *  Parsing is separating a sequence of characters into tokens based on
         *      delimiters.
         *      
         *      A token is a meaningful sequence of characters (e.g., word).
         *      
         *      Delimiters are characters that separate tokens
         *          (by default, whitespace (space, tab, newline)).
         *          
         *  When we create a Scanner object, we have to specify the input stream
         *      (e.g., System.in which is the terminal input).

         *      2. use print, not println; so that the cursor is at the end of the

         *      exception is generated.
